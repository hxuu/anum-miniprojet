Welcome to **Anum-Miniprojet**, a simple project for implementing numerical analysis algorithms in R. This project is structured to organize algorithms by chapters, each containing its relevant scripts and documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **R** (version 4.0 or above)
- Basic R knowledge (not mandatory, but helpful)

> You can check R docs [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hxuu/anum-miniprojet.git
cd anum-miniprojet
```

2. Run the main.R script to get started:

```bash
Rscript main.R
```

> [!TIP]
> Finite differences algorithm should be ran from the finite_diff.R file because
the example in main.R is NOT equi-distant.

3. Explore the algorithms:

    * Navigate to the R/ directory to find the scripts.
    * Modify or run any script as needed.
